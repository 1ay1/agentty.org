Everything you can do without leaving the home row.

## Global

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| [[Enter]] | Send the current message |
| [[Esc]] | Cancel the current turn / reject a permission / close a modal (does NOT quit) |
| [[S-Tab]] | Cycle permission profile (Write → Ask → Minimal) |
| [[Ctrl+K]] | Command palette |
| [[Ctrl+J]] | Thread list (opens at the current thread) |
| [[Ctrl+N]] | New thread |
| [[Alt+←/→]] | Quick-cycle to the adjacent thread (← newer, → older) |
| [[Ctrl+←/→]] | Quick-cycle threads (empty composer, idle session) |
| [[Ctrl+T]] | Todo / plan view |
| [[Ctrl+/]] | Model picker — **one list across every provider you're signed into** (fuzzy-search, `Enter` switches provider+model atomically) |
| [[Ctrl+Tab]] | Quick-swap to the previous model you used (jumps across providers) |
| [[Ctrl+P]] | Provider picker (manage/switch LLM backends, hosts, accounts) |
| [[Ctrl+S]] | Smart Mode overlay (routing + learning) |
| [[Ctrl+G]] | Run a code block from the newest reply on your real terminal |
| [[Ctrl+R]] | Review pending diffs |
| [[Ctrl+O]] | Browse the full text of a frozen retrieved-context card |
| [[Ctrl+U]] | Expand / collapse the newest retrieved-context card (empty composer) |
| [[Ctrl+L]] | Redraw the screen |
| [[Ctrl+C]] | Quit (the only quit key) |

> **Every open key toggles.** Pressing a modal's own open key again while
> it's up closes it — [[Ctrl+P]] shuts the provider picker, [[Ctrl+K]] the
> command palette, [[Ctrl+S]] the Smart Mode overlay, and so on. The model
> and provider pickers also **cross-hop**: [[Ctrl+P]] from the model picker
> jumps to the provider picker, [[Ctrl+/]] does the reverse.

> **The model picker spans every provider.** [[Ctrl+/]] opens one fuzzy list
> of every model on every backend you're signed into — type `son` for every
> Sonnet, `gpt` for every GPT — and [[Enter]] switches provider **and** model
> in a single step. A **recent** section (the models you toggle between) sits
> up top, and providers you're *not* signed into appear as dim **sign in to …**
> rows that drop straight into login. [[Ctrl+Tab]] jumps to your previous
> model without opening anything. Use [[Ctrl+P]] when you want to *manage*
> backends (add a custom host, switch accounts) rather than pick a model.

> **If [[Ctrl+/]] or [[Ctrl+Tab]] do nothing, your terminal can't encode them.**
> `Ctrl`+`/` and `Ctrl`+`Tab` are among the few chords legacy terminals
> literally cannot send (on most, `Ctrl`+`Tab` is byte-identical to `Tab`).
> agentty negotiates the **kitty keyboard protocol** on startup, so the keys
> work on terminals that support it — kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, foot, Konsole,
> recent xterm/Alacritty, iTerm2 3.5+, and **Blink Shell** on iOS. On a
> terminal that can't (notably **mosh** sessions, some minimal iOS SSH apps),
> use the always-portable routes instead: type **`/model`** (or `/swap`) in
> the composer, or open the command palette with [[Ctrl+K]] and pick
> **"Switch model"** / **"Swap to previous model"**. Both work on every
> terminal. (Set `MAYA_NO_KITTY_KEYBOARD=1` to disable the protocol.)

> **Esc steps back one level.** In a multi-step flow — provider picker →
> **Custom host…** → host input → API-key prompt — [[Esc]] pops one level
> at a time (and restores what you typed) rather than collapsing the whole
> stack. The footer shows `Esc back` when there's a parent, `Esc cancel`
> when there isn't.

## Composer

The composer is a full readline-style editor. Keys are grouped below by what
they do.

### Submit & compose

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| [[Enter]] | Send the message (or, while streaming, queue it) |
| [[Shift+Enter]] | Insert a newline |
| [[Alt+Enter]] | Insert a newline (fallback for terminals that don't deliver Shift+Enter) |
| [[Ctrl+E]] | Toggle the expanded (taller) composer |
| [[/]] | Open the command palette — when line-leading (start of buffer or after a newline) |
| [[@]] | Open the file-mention picker — at a word boundary; inserts an `@file` chip |
| [[#]] | Open the symbol picker — at a word boundary; inserts a `#symbol` chip |

### Cursor motion

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| [[←]] / [[→]] | Move one character (steps over an attachment chip as a single unit) |
| [[Ctrl+←]] / [[Ctrl+→]] | Move one word (a run of punctuation counts as one unit) |
| [[Home]] / [[End]] | Jump to start / end of the buffer |

[[Ctrl+←]] / [[Ctrl+→]] switch to word-motion only when the composer has text;
on an **empty** composer with an idle session they cycle threads instead (same
as [[Alt+←/→]]).

### Editing

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| [[Backspace]] | Delete the character (or whole chip) before the cursor |
| [[Ctrl+W]] | Delete the word before the cursor (readline *unix-word-rubout*) |
| [[Alt+D]] | Delete the word after the cursor (readline *kill-word*) |
| [[Ctrl+U]] | Kill to beginning of line |
| [[Alt+K]] | Kill to end of line |
| [[Ctrl+Z]] | Undo — rewinds word-by-word, not keystroke-by-keystroke |
| [[Ctrl+Y]] / [[Ctrl+Shift+Z]] | Redo |
| [[Ctrl+V]] / [[Alt+V]] | Paste an image from the clipboard as an attachment chip |

Undo coalesces a run of typing into one step (broken on whitespace and on any
non-typing edit), so one [[Ctrl+Z]] after a paste reaches the pre-paste state.
[[Ctrl+V]] is intercepted by some terminals (Windows Terminal binds it to its
own paste); [[Alt+V]] is the fallback that every terminal passes through.
Pasting an image **over SSH** needs one setting — kitty must be allowed to
answer clipboard reads, and tmux must pass the request through. See
[Clipboard & Images](/docs/clipboard).

> Kill-to-end is [[Alt+K]], not the readline-standard [[Ctrl+K]] — [[Ctrl+K]] is
> reserved app-wide for the command palette. It pairs with [[Ctrl+U]]
> (kill-to-start) the same way [[Alt+D]] (delete word forward) pairs with
> [[Ctrl+W]] (delete word back). [[Ctrl+U]] also doubles as “expand/collapse the
> newest retrieved-context card” **when the composer is empty** and such a card
> is on screen; with text in the box it always means kill-to-line-start.

### History & queue

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| [[↑]] | On an empty composer: recall queued messages (if any), else walk back through your previous messages |
| [[↓]] | Walk forward through history toward the live draft |
| [[Alt+↑]] | Edit queued messages one at a time (loads the most recently queued first) |
| [[Alt+↓]] | Step back out of the per-item queue editor toward the live draft |
| [[Alt+Backspace]] | Drop the most recently queued message (empty composer, nothing peeked) |

## Queue behavior

Typing while a turn streams **queues** the message rather than interrupting.
There are two ways to work with the queue:

- **[[↑]] on an empty composer** pulls *every* queued message back into the
  buffer at once (joined by newlines, cursor at the seam) — destructive on the
  queue, so re-submit to re-queue.
- **[[Alt+↑]] / [[Alt+↓]]** step through the queue **one message at a time** to
  fix a single entry; [[Enter]] re-queues the edited message in place. This
  works even mid-edit, so you don't have to clear the composer first.

The composer placeholder hints `press ↑ to edit queued — type to queue
another…` when relevant.

## Review pane ([[Ctrl+R]])

When the agent has edited files, [[Ctrl+R]] opens the review pane. Edits are already on disk — the pane is a keep/undo gate.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| [[j]] / [[k]] or [[↑]] / [[↓]] | Move between hunks |
| [[h]] / [[l]] or [[Tab]] | Previous / next file |
| [[y]] / [[Enter]] | Accept the current hunk (keep it) |
| [[n]] | Reject the current hunk (revert it) |
| [[Ctrl+D]] / [[Ctrl+U]] or [[PgDn]] / [[PgUp]] | Scroll inside a hunk taller than the viewport |
| [[Ctrl+A]] | Accept all — keep every change |
| [[Ctrl+X]] | Reject all — revert every file (two-press to confirm) |
| [[Esc]] / [[q]] | Close — keeps accepted + undecided hunks, reverts rejected ones |

> **[[Esc]] commits, it does not cancel.** Closing keeps every undecided
> hunk (the edit is already live). The footer says `Esc keep all` /
> `keep rest` / `apply` so the outcome is never a surprise. To throw away
> *everything*, use [[Ctrl+X]] (Reject all).

## Palette-only actions

Some actions have no dedicated key — reach them from the command palette
([[Ctrl+K]]). Notably **Rewind to checkpoint** opens a diff-preview picker over
every checkpointed turn (git repo + idle session); see
[Checkpoints & rewind](/docs/threads#checkpoints). **Fork thread** branches the
current conversation into a fresh thread that carries near-zero context — the
parent transcript is read on demand — to escape a full context window; see
[Forking a Thread](/docs/fork). **Compaction depth** cycles
how full the context window gets before agentty auto-compacts in the background
(75/90/95%) — see [Providers & Models](/docs/providers#1m-context-models).
