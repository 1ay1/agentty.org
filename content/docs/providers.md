agentty is **bring-your-own-model**: it speaks to any OpenAI-compatible backend, plus Anthropic and local Ollama. Sign in with a subscription you already pay for — Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro, GitHub Copilot, or **Kimi** — or bring an API key for **DeepSeek, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, Cerebras, Fireworks**, or any custom endpoint. Pick one with `--provider`, or switch live mid-thread with `^P` (provider) and `^/` (model) — both overlays have a **live search filter**, so just start typing (`kimi`, `grok`, `deepseek`…) to jump to a provider.

## Pick a provider

Sign in with a subscription (no API key), bring a hosted provider's API key, or point agentty at a local Ollama model that needs no key at all.

```bash
# Sign in with a subscription — no API key (see the sections below)
agentty login                              # 1) Claude  2) ChatGPT  3) Copilot  4) Kimi
agentty --provider kimi                    # Kimi K2 via your Kimi plan

# Bring an API key
agentty --provider deepseek -m deepseek-v4-pro   # DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
agentty --provider gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro      # Google Gemini (GEMINI_API_KEY)
agentty --provider xai -m grok-4.6               # xAI Grok (XAI_API_KEY)
agentty --provider groq -m llama-3.3-70b         # Groq
agentty --provider openrouter                    # any model via OpenRouter
agentty --provider ollama -m qwen2.5-coder       # local model, no key
agentty -m claude-opus-4-5                        # Claude (API key or Pro/Max OAuth)
```

`--provider` and `-m` are persisted between runs, so you only pass them when you want to change the backend.

Inside a thread, press `^P` to switch provider and `^/` to switch model — no restart, no re-auth. Both are also reachable from the command palette (`^K`). The next turn uses the new backend.

## 1M-context models

Signed in with Claude Pro/Max OAuth, the model picker offers a **"(1M context)"** row right below the base model for every Sonnet/Opus/Haiku 4+ model — e.g. `Claude Opus 4.8` followed by `Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context)`. Picking the 1M row widens the context window agentty tracks for that model from 200K to 1M tokens: the status bar's context gauge and auto-compaction both use the wider ceiling, so a long session with a large codebase can grow much further before agentty needs to summarize it. The 1M variant sends Anthropic's extended-context beta on your behalf; nothing else changes about how you use the model. A raw API key isn't offered the 1M row (the beta is account-tier gated and a lower tier would 400 on a request over 200K) — it's available on the OAuth path.

Even a 1M window eventually fills on a long session. When it does, you can [fork](/docs/fork) the thread into a fresh one that carries near-zero context (the parent transcript is read on demand) instead of compacting in place — an O(1)-token way to keep going with a clean slate.

## API keys

Hosted OpenAI-compatible providers read their key from the provider-specific environment variable (e.g. `GROQ_API_KEY`), falling back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or an explicit `-k <key>` for the session. Ollama needs no key.

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_…
agentty --provider groq -m llama-3.3-70b

# or a one-off, never written to disk:
agentty --provider openai -k sk-… -m gpt-4o
```

### Custom hosts

Point agentty at **any** server that speaks the OpenAI chat API — llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, a gateway, or a remote box. Add one from the picker (`^P` → **Custom host…**) or with `--provider`:

```bash
agentty --provider localhost:8080 -m my-model          # local, no key
agentty --provider https://chat.example.org/api -k sk-… -m GLM-5.2
```

**Connect-time probe.** When you press Enter on a local host, agentty **checks it before switching**: it dials the server's model list (your configured path, then `/v1/models`, then Ollama's native `/api/tags`) and only commits on an answer — with a toast naming what it found (`✓ 12 models · openai-compatible · 45ms · /v1/models`). A dead or mis-specced host returns you to the input with the reason ("nothing listening — is the server running?") and your typed spec intact. The probe also **detects the dialect** — a bare Ollama daemon is recognised by `/api/tags` — so you don't have to know what your server speaks.

**The `/v1` default.** The OpenAI dialect lives under `/v1` on every real server — `api.openai.com/v1`, llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama's compat shim. A bare host or `host:port` (and a bare URL like `http://localhost:8080/`) therefore defaults to the `/v1` prefix, so agentty chats at `…/v1/chat/completions` and lists models at `…/v1/models`. This is the single most common local-server mistake: a spec without `/v1` used to 404 every request.

**Explicit paths are honoured verbatim.** If your gateway serves on a different prefix, put it in the URL and agentty keeps it exactly:

```bash
agentty --provider https://chat.example.org/api -k sk-…    # → /api/chat/completions, /api/models
```

**Scheme / port heuristics.** `https://` (or a bare host on 443) uses TLS; `http://` or any non-443 port uses plain HTTP (the local-server convention). A TLS host prompts for an API key; a local host commits keyless.

**Multiple accounts on the same endpoint.** Append `#name` to keep several logins to the *same* server distinct — each keeps its own API key, saved model, and picker row:

```bash
agentty --provider https://ollama.com/v1#work
agentty --provider https://ollama.com/v1#personal
```

The `#name` is a local tag only — it never reaches the wire — but it shows on the picker row so you can tell the accounts apart. (Native-OAuth providers — Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Kimi — have their own in-app multi-account manager; `#name` is for API-key custom hosts.)

Custom hosts you add are **saved** — they reappear in the `^P` picker every session (`Del` on a row removes one, two-press). A local host committed without a key is saved too, so you never re-type it.

### Adding one from the TUI

You don't need the CLI, and you don't need to hunt for a menu. Open `^P` and **just type the endpoint**:

```
^P  →  yolo-auto.com

  Use yolo-auto.com  as a custom OpenAI-compatible host      ⏎ connect
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ⏎ connects to yolo-auto.com · agentty probes it and adopts the dialect it finds
```

The moment what you type looks like an endpoint — it has a dot, a `host:port`, or an `https://` — the picker offers it as the **first** row. `Enter` carries the text straight into the connect modal (no retyping) and probes the server: it tries the configured models path, then `/v1/models`, then Ollama's `/api/tags`, adopts whichever answers, and reports `✓ 12 models · openai · 45ms` before committing. A dead endpoint never becomes your active provider.

Searching also reaches hosts you've **already saved**, so `gw.internal` jumps straight to that row instead of making you scroll past every built-in.

:::tip You do not need a built-in row
The provider list is a convenience for endpoints with quirks — their own transport, OAuth, a second dialect, a non-standard port. **Any** plain OpenAI-compatible server works through the custom-host path with no code change, which is why llama.cpp, vLLM and LM Studio don't have rows either.
:::

:::tip Debugging a custom host
Set `AGENTTY_LOG=wire=trace`  to see the exact request path, status, and response your server returned — see **[Logging & diagnostics](/docs/logging)**. The most common issues are a missing `/v1` (→ 404) and a model id that doesn't match what `/v1/models` reports.
:::

### Known working endpoints

Hosted gateways that work through the custom-host path as is. Type the spec into `^P` (or pass it to `--provider`), then paste the key when prompted, pass `-k`, or set `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

| Endpoint | Spec | Key | Example model |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Requesty](https://docs.requesty.ai) | `https://router.requesty.ai/v1` (EU: `https://router.eu.requesty.ai/v1`) | [app.requesty.ai/api-keys](https://app.requesty.ai/api-keys) | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` |

```bash
agentty --provider https://router.requesty.ai/v1 -k <key> -m openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

## Sign in with GitHub Copilot

If you have a GitHub Copilot subscription (Individual, Business, or Enterprise), you can use its models — GPT-4o, o-series, Claude, Gemini, and more — through your existing Copilot plan, **no API key required**.

```bash
agentty login          # choose "Sign in with GitHub Copilot"
agentty --provider copilot
```

Sign-in uses GitHub's **device flow**: agentty shows a one-time code and opens `github.com/login/device` (works over SSH too — just enter the code in any browser). The available model list is fetched live from your account's entitlements, so you see exactly the models your plan offers. agentty stores a durable GitHub token (encrypted, at `~/.config/agentty/copilot_credentials.json`) and transparently exchanges it for the short-lived Copilot session token, refreshing mid-session so long agent runs never drop. `agentty status` shows your plan, entitlement, and the active inference host; `agentty logout` → GitHub Copilot signs out.

:::note
Copilot routes to the right host automatically (Individual / Business / Enterprise each use a different endpoint) — there's nothing to configure. On the free Copilot tier, agentty surfaces a clear "chat quota exhausted" message rather than a raw error.
:::

## Sign in with Kimi

If you have a [Kimi](https://www.kimi.com) plan, sign in with it and run agentty on Kimi's K2 models — **no API key required**.

```bash
agentty login          # choose "Sign in with Kimi"
agentty --provider kimi
```

Sign-in uses Kimi's **OAuth device flow** (RFC 8628), the same in-terminal experience as Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot: agentty shows a one-time code and opens the Kimi authorization page in your browser. It works over SSH — in the modal press [[c]] to copy the **code** and [[u]] to copy the **URL** (both sent via OSC 52, so they land on your local clipboard even through a remote session), then paste in any browser. [[o]] re-opens the browser. agentty polls in the background and switches the moment you approve.

The token is stored encrypted at `~/.config/agentty/kimi_credentials.json` and refreshed automatically mid-session, so long agent runs never drop. The picker row reflects real sign-in state (`⚠ sign in with Kimi` / `✓ signed in`), and pressing [[Enter]] on the active Kimi row opens the **multi-account manager** (switch / add / remove Kimi accounts) — hold several Kimi accounts and switch entirely in-app. `agentty status` shows the active account; `agentty logout` → Kimi signs out.

:::tip
Kimi's inference runs on its OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so tool-calling, streaming, and reasoning all work exactly as they do on every other provider — nothing Kimi-specific to configure. Prefer a raw platform API key instead of the subscription? Use any OpenAI-compatible host: `agentty --provider https://api.moonshot.ai -k <key> -m kimi-k2-0905-preview`.
:::

## DeepSeek

[DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com) is a first-class built-in provider. It uses a **static API key** (DeepSeek doesn't offer developer OAuth), so set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` — or pass `-k`, or paste it into the in-app prompt once.

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-…
agentty --provider deepseek -m deepseek-v4-pro      # strong general/coding model
agentty --provider deepseek -m deepseek-reasoner    # reasoning model (thinking)
```

DeepSeek's endpoints live at the API root (no `/v1` prefix) — agentty handles that automatically. Both the chat and reasoner families are recognized as native tool-callers, and **reasoning streams live**: on a reasoning model agentty renders DeepSeek's chain-of-thought exactly like Claude's thinking, and the effort control (cycle it in the model picker) maps straight to the wire. Selecting DeepSeek in `^P` before you've set a key still shows its models (a small bundled list) so you can pick one immediately; the live catalog replaces it once your key is set.

## Local models (Ollama)

Point agentty at a model served by Ollama on `localhost:11434` — no key, no cloud, no data leaving your machine. agentty uses Ollama's native `/api/chat` protocol and salvages tool calls that weaker local models leak as raw JSON, so even smaller models can drive the full tool suite.

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder
agentty --provider ollama -m qwen2.5-coder
```

:::note
`--provider` and `-m` persist between sessions. Run `agentty --provider anthropic` to switch to Claude, or just press `^P` in-app.
:::

### Slow first token is normal

A large local model (20-30B on consumer hardware) processes the prompt in **complete silence** before its first token — that can take minutes on a long prompt. agentty knows this: on a local provider the phase chip reads **“processing…”** (not “Streaming”) until the first byte arrives, and the idle/stall timeouts are stretched to 10 minutes for plaintext endpoints (vs 90 s for hosted APIs), so a slow model is never mistaken for a hang. `Esc` still cancels instantly.

### When a local model won't respond

If prompts fail immediately (rather than after a long think), agentty now tells you *why* instead of retrying forever:

- **404 on every request** — the spec is missing its `/v1` prefix, or the model id isn't loaded. agentty's error names both, and a custom host added without `/v1` is probed against `/v1/models` automatically.
- **Streamed errors** — llama.cpp reports failures as a mid-stream `event: error` under HTTP 200. agentty surfaces the server's actual message (a chat-template rejection, a bad alias) instead of silently looping.
- **A retry ladder that can't make progress** — after 6 attempts with no model output, agentty stops with *“giving up after 6 failed attempts with no model output — check the server/model”* rather than hammering a broken endpoint.
- **A stale saved model** — if the model id recalled for a local host isn't in its live `/v1/models` list, agentty refuses cleanly (*“model X isn't served by this host — pick one (^/)”*) instead of 400-ing every prompt.

When in doubt, `AGENTTY_LOG=wire=trace agentty` shows the exact request and response — see **[Logging & diagnostics](/docs/logging)**.
